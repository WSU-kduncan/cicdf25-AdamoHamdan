# Project 4/5: CI-CD

## General Overview
The two project contents seen on this repository contain the use of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). These two help to create the concept of a pipeline meant to constantly (or shall I say...continuously) implement, create, and develop web content to maintain a specific or refreshed version images of this said content.

In order to do so, the projects implemented the usages of Git Workflows, Webhooks, bash scripting, usage of a web content folder initialized with a Dockerfile, and many more features in order to implement the CI/CD Pipeline

Reference to [Project 4 Overview](README-CI.md): Here you will learn about how the Git Workflow operates (content within workflows folder) through the usage of GitHub Actions with the triggers of pushes to main with and the usages of tags with semantic versioning

Reference to [Project 5 Overview](README-CD.md): Here you will learn about how the webhook operate in relation to its set up service file and hook listener (content within deployment folder) in order to deploy a new container running a new version of the docker web content image
